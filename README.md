## Help & Troubleshooting

* Q: Why are my credentials not working?
  * A: Please ensure that your credentials are correct and that you have not made any typos.

* Q: Why is the tool not working?
  * A: Please ensure using a https proxy that there is no programming errors. If there is, please report it to me.

* What is a device.wvd file?
  * A: A device.wvd file is a file that contains the WidevineÂ® DRM license for the tool.

* What is a cfg.json file?
  * A: A cfg.json file is a file that contains the user's credentials. It is used to login to the user's Amazon Music account.

* What is a rpc_quotes.txt file?
  * A: A rpc_quotes.txt file is a file that contains quotes for the Discord Rich Presence. A default one is provided if a file is not found.

* Why is my search cache so large?
  * To clear your search cache, please wait 1 hour for the previous queries to be invalidated or manually delete the file yourself.

* Why do we need a decryption key cache?
  * A: A decryption key cache is used to speed up the decryption process.
  * Q: Why is my decryption key cache so large?
  * A: Your decryption key cache is large because you have been using the tool for a long time. Clearing it is not recommended. As the more keys you have, if the widevine protocol is ever updated, the keys will still be there.

* Why do I need user_agents.json?
  * A: user_agents.json is a file that contains a list of user agents. It is used to bypass Amazon's device verification. As the dynamically changing user agents confuse amazon, user agent randomization is used to prevent profiling and tracing of our tool.

* Why am I stuck with OPUS 320kbps?
  * A: Amazon Music only supports Opus 320kbps. To stream or download in other formats, use `--hd-enable` or `--uhd-enable`. The status of your Amazon Music subscription does not matter. For some reason, anyway.

* What is mpv?
  * A: mpv is a media player that can play audio and video files. It is used to play the downloaded songs. Please install it from [here](https://mpv.io/installation/).

Example:
```
python3.12 dist/production.py --use-cache --tracksearch --search "Shout Out to My Ex"
```
